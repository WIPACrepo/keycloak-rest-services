# Leaving an Institution

Existing users can leave an institution by editing their profile at
[https://user-management.icecube.aq](https://user-management.icecube.aq).

Here is an example of the profile page:

To leave an institution, select "Leave institution".

This action is processed immediately, and the profile page should be
automatically refreshed to not show that institution.
