"""
Synchronize/update memberships of Google Workspace mailing groups/lists
to match their corresponding Keycloak "mail groups".

First, some nomenclature. A "[Keycloak] mail group" is a direct subgroup
of the /mail group. Subgroups of a Keycloak mail group are NOT considered
here to be mail groups per se, even though their members may be subscribed
to the mailing list associated with their ancestor group that is a direct
subgroup of /mail (subgroup handling described below).

In order to be operated on by this script, mail groups must define attribute
`email` to match them to the corresponding Google Workspace mailing group/list.
Note the `email` attribute of recursive subgroups, if defined, will be ignored.

Only Google Workspace group members whose role is 'MANAGER' or 'MEMBER'
are managed. 'OWNER' members should be managed by other means.

Members of all recursive subgroups of a mail groups will be subscribed to the
list. This is to support such use patterns as:
 - A mail group membership is managed by an automated process, but the
    corresponding mailing list needs to have some extra members that the
    process doesn't recognize.
 - A subgroup of a mail group is automatically managed, for example when
    policy requires members of one group to also be members of another group.

Furthermore, all recursive subgroups called "_admin" and "_managers" will be
subscribed as managers. The special group _managers is needed to designate
users with role MANAGER for groups that are automatically generated (and
therefore can't have an _admin subgroup).

Users are subscribed to Google Workspace groups using their KeyCloak
`canonical_email` attribute, unless it is overridden by `mailing_list_email`.
Use of `canonical_email`, instead of just username@icecube.wisc.edu, is needed
for the *VERY* rare case of the keycloak user not being in Google Workspace.
(In this case, the user would send messages to the list from their canonical
address, as this is what our mail server is configured to do, so that's the
address they must be subscribed to the list with.) Once we stop using our
own mail server, this requirement will become unnecessary. Removing code
that implements this requirement will necessitate some member conversions
but will simplify code.

Users can optionally be notified of changes via email. SMTP server is
controlled by the EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER environmental variable and defaults
to localhost. See send_email() in krs/email.py for more email options.

KeyCloak REST client is typically configured using environment variables.
See krs/token.py for details.

Domain-wide delegation must be enabled for the Google Workspace service
account and appropriate scopes authorized. See code for which scopes are
required. Admin API must be enabled in the Google Cloud Console project.

The admin account on whose behalf the service account will act *may* need to
have "Service Account Token Creator" role (in Google Cloud project under IAM).

This code uses custom keycloak attributes that are documented here:
https://bookstack.icecube.wisc.edu/ops/books/services/page/custom-keycloak-attributes
PLEASE KEEP THAT PAGE IN-SYNC WITH THIS CODE.
